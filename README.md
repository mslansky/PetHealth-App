You can create a PET PROFILE for each of your pets! Within these profiles you can create daily diary entries.

- you will also be able to print a CUMULATIVE report of all of your pet's diary entries to give to your vet, or keep for your records!

This project was created as my first full stack application. This is the client side of the application which utilized React on the front end. Testing is implemented for all components. This was my first capstone project for the THINKFUL engineering immersion bootcamp.
